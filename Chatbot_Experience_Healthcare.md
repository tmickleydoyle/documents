# System Design Document for Healthcare Chatbot

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system design for a healthcare chatbot that assists users in finding specific healthcare-related information. The chatbot will engage with users to understand their queries and trigger appropriate API calls to retrieve the required information. The system will also include user and event tracking to improve the chatbot's performance over time.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Core Functionality

- **User Engagement**: The chatbot will engage with users to understand their healthcare-related queries.
- **API Integration**: The chatbot will trigger API calls to retrieve dynamic information such as HSA balances, co-pay details, etc.
- **User Authentication**: Users will need to authenticate before the chatbot can trigger API calls.
- **Event Tracking**: All interactions, API calls, and user events will be tracked for future improvements.

### 2.2 Key Components

- **Chatbot Interface**: The user-facing component where interactions occur.
- **API Gateway**: Manages and routes API calls to the appropriate backend services.
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Event Tracking System**: Logs all interactions and events for analysis and improvement.
- **Database**: Stores user data, event logs, and other relevant information.

## 3. User and Bot Interaction

### 3.1 User Flow

1. **Initial Engagement**: The user initiates a conversation with the chatbot.
2. **Query Understanding**: The chatbot attempts to understand the user's query.
3. **Authentication**: If the query requires personalized information, the chatbot prompts the user to authenticate.
4. **API Call**: The chatbot triggers the appropriate API call to retrieve the information.
5. **Response**: The chatbot provides the retrieved information to the user.
6. **Fallback**: If the chatbot is unsure, it suggests contacting customer support.

### 3.2 Bot Flow

1. **Query Analysis**: The chatbot analyzes the user's query to determine the intent.
2. **API Mapping**: The chatbot maps the intent to the corresponding API endpoint.
3. **Authentication Check**: The chatbot checks if the user is authenticated.
4. **API Request**: The chatbot makes an API request to the backend service.
5. **Response Handling**: The chatbot processes the API response and formats it for the user.
6. **Event Logging**: The chatbot logs the interaction and events for future analysis.

## 4. API Gateway

### 4.1 Overview

The API Gateway acts as the central hub for managing and routing API calls from the chatbot to the appropriate backend services. It ensures secure, efficient, and scalable communication between the chatbot and various healthcare-related services.

### 4.2 Key Responsibilities

- **Request Routing**: Directs API requests to the correct backend service based on the endpoint.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Validates user tokens and ensures that the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a certain time frame.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Logs all API requests and responses for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend service instances to ensure high availability and reliability.

### 4.3 Components

- **Request Handler**: Receives and processes incoming API requests.
- **Authentication Module**: Validates user tokens and checks permissions.
- **Routing Module**: Determines the appropriate backend service for each request.
- **Rate Limiter**: Enforces rate limiting policies.
- **Logger**: Logs all API requests and responses.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests across backend service instances.

## 5. API Selection Mechanism

### 5.1 Intent Mapping

The chatbot will use intent mapping to determine which API to call based on the user's query. The intent mapping process involves the following steps:

1. **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot analyzes the user's query to recognize the intent. For example, a query like "What is my HSA balance?" will be mapped to the intent `GET_HSA_BALANCE`.
2. **Entity Extraction**: The chatbot extracts relevant entities from the query. For example, in the query "What was my last co-pay for the dentist?", the entity `dentist` will be extracted.
3. **API Mapping**: The chatbot maps the recognized intent and extracted entities to the corresponding API endpoint. For example, the intent `GET_HSA_BALANCE` will be mapped to the `/getHSABalance` endpoint.

### 5.2 API Endpoints

The following are examples of API endpoints that the chatbot can call:

- `/getHSABalance`: Retrieves the user's HSA balance.
  - **Intent**: `GET_HSA_BALANCE`
  - **Entities**: None

- `/getLastCoPay`: Retrieves the user's last co-pay details.
  - **Intent**: `GET_LAST_CO_PAY`
  - **Entities**: `service_type` (e.g., dentist, doctor)

- `/getAppointmentDetails`: Retrieves the user's appointment details.
  - **Intent**: `GET_APPOINTMENT_DETAILS`
  - **Entities**: `appointment_id`

- `/getPrescriptionDetails`: Retrieves the user's prescription details.
  - **Intent**: `GET_PRESCRIPTION_DETAILS`
  - **Entities**: `prescription_id`

### 5.3 API Selection Flow

1. **User Query**: The user inputs a query, such as "What is my HSA balance?".
2. **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot recognizes the intent `GET_HSA_BALANCE`.
3. **Entity Extraction**: The chatbot extracts any relevant entities from the query.
4. **API Mapping**: The chatbot maps the intent and entities to the `/getHSABalance` endpoint.
5. **API Request**: The chatbot sends a request to the API Gateway with the mapped endpoint.
6. **API Response**: The API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate backend service, which processes the request and returns the response.
7. **Response Handling**: The chatbot receives the response from the API Gateway and formats it for the user.

### 5.4 Example Scenario

**User Query**: "What was my last co-pay for the dentist?"

1. **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot recognizes the intent `GET_LAST_CO_PAY`.
2. **Entity Extraction**: The chatbot extracts the entity `service_type` with the value `dentist`.
3. **API Mapping**: The chatbot maps the intent and entity to the `/getLastCoPay` endpoint with the parameter `service_type=dentist`.
4. **API Request**: The chatbot sends a request to the API Gateway with the endpoint `/getLastCoPay?service_type=dentist`.
5. **API Response**: The API Gateway routes the request to the backend service, which retrieves the last co-pay details for the dentist and returns the response.
6. **Response Handling**: The chatbot receives the response and formats it for the user, displaying the last co-pay details for the dentist.

# Prioritizing Projects for Data Teams: A Strategic Approach

## Introduction

In managing data teams that span data platform development, analytics engineering, and data analysis, it's crucial to strategically prioritize projects to maximize impact and efficiency. The goal is to balance the need for gaining new insights, building robust systems, and supporting the business's evolving requirements. This document outlines the approach to project prioritization, considering various factors that influence the decision-making process, including the balance between optimizing for new customers and retaining existing customers.

### Key Factors in Project Prioritization

**1. Impact on the Company and Customers**

- **Scope of Impact:** How many customers will be affected by the project? Consider both immediate and potential future impacts.
- **Criticality:** What is the consequence of not doing this work? Could it lead to lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction, or missed opportunities?
Measuring Success: Define clear metrics to determine the project's success, such as increased customer satisfaction, improved performance, or reduction in operational costs.

**2. Gaining New Business Insights**

- **Innovative Discoveries:** Does the project have the potential to uncover insights that haven't been achieved before?
- **Strategic Value:** How valuable are these insights for strategic decision-making? Will they inform key business strategies or open up new avenues for growth?

**3. Building and Enhancing Systems for Future Work**

- **Scalability:** Will the system being built support not just the current project but also future initiatives?
- **Efficiency Gains:** How much time and effort will this system save in future projects? Does it make data processing faster, more accurate, or more reliable?

**4. Empowering Self-Service for Other Teams**

- **Self-Sufficiency:** Does the project create tools or systems that allow other teams to access and use data without direct involvement from the data team?
- **Long-Term Benefits:** Consider the long-term reduction in the data team's workload by enabling other teams to self-serve.

**5. Supporting New Product Launches**

- **Early-Stage Initiatives:** Some projects might support new products with a small user base but have been requested by customers.
- **Future Potential:** While these projects might not have immediate large-scale impact, they could be crucial as the product grows and gains more users.

### Balancing Priorities: New Customers vs. Existing Customers

An essential aspect of project prioritization is balancing the needs of new customers with those of existing customers. This balance is vital for both short-term success and long-term sustainability.

**1. Optimizing for Existing Customers**

- **Measuring Stickiness:** For existing customers, projects that enhance user experience, reliability, or functionality can increase stickinessâ€”keeping customers engaged and reducing churn.
- **Revenue Growth from Loyalty:** Loyal customers often contribute significantly to revenue through repeat purchases, upsells, and word-of-mouth referrals. Projects that improve customer satisfaction can lead to higher lifetime value.

**2. Optimizing for New Customers**

- **Acquiring New Users:** Projects that focus on features or data insights to attract new customers are crucial for expanding the user base. These might include enhancements to onboarding processes or targeted analytics that identify potential growth markets.
- **Revenue from Expansion:** Bringing in new customers is essential for revenue growth, especially as the business scales. However, new customer acquisition should not come at the cost of neglecting the needs of existing users.

**3. Finding the Balance**

- **Strategic Allocation:** Balancing projects between new and existing customers requires a nuanced approach. For instance, data teams might work on projects that enhance the user experience for existing customers while simultaneously building predictive models to identify and attract new customers.
- **Measuring Success:** To determine the effectiveness of these projects, it's crucial to measure key metrics for both customer segments:
- **Stickiness for Existing Customers:** Metrics such as retention rates, repeat usage, and customer satisfaction scores can indicate how well projects are serving the existing customer base.
- **Growth for New Customers:** Metrics such as new user acquisition, conversion rates, and early retention can show how effectively the business is attracting and engaging new customers.

**4. Adapting to Business Needs**

- **Dynamic Weighting:** The focus on either new or existing customers can shift based on the business stage. For instance, during a product launch, prioritizing projects that attract new customers may be essential. Conversely, during a consolidation phase, projects that deepen engagement with existing customers might take precedence.

### A Dynamic Weighting System

The prioritization of projects is not a static process. The importance of each factor can change based on the current needs of the business and the balance between serving new and existing customers. For example:

- **Growth Phase:** During a period of rapid expansion, projects that focus on Acquiring New Users and Supporting New Product Launches might be prioritized to bring in a larger customer base.

- **Retention Phase:** In contrast, when the focus is on retaining and maximizing value from the current customer base, projects that enhance Measuring Stickiness and Revenue Growth from Loyalty might be prioritized.

## Introduction

The Monstera framework relies on accurate, timely, and consistent data to enable data-driven decision making across the organization. When metrics deviate from expected patterns or systems experience issues, rapid and appropriate escalation is critical to maintaining trust in the data ecosystem.

### Scope and Objectives

This escalation guide addresses:
- **Data Quality Issues**: Metrics showing unexpected values or trends
- **System Performance Issues**: Slow queries, dashboard timeouts, pipeline failures
- **Schema Compliance Problems**: Events not following Monstera standards
- **Access and Permission Issues**: Users unable to access needed dashboards or data
- **Business Logic Discrepancies**: Metric calculations not matching business expectations

### Key Principles

1. **Speed Over Perfection**: Get the right people involved quickly, refine understanding iteratively
2. **Clear Communication**: Stakeholders need to understand impact and timeline
3. **Documentation**: Every incident teaches us how to improve the system
4. **Proportional Response**: Match escalation level to business impact
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use incident patterns to strengthen preventive measures

## Preventive Measures

### Proactive Monitoring Enhancement

#### Expand Automated Alerting
Based on incident patterns, implement:

```sql
-- Example: Business Logic Validation
-- Alert if key metrics deviate significantly from predictions
WITH metric_validation AS (
  SELECT
    metric_date,
    daily_active_users,
    -- Simple moving average prediction
    AVG(daily_active_users) OVER (
      ORDER BY metric_date
      ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
    ) as predicted_dau,

    -- Calculate deviation percentage
    ABS(daily_active_users - predicted_dau) / predicted_dau * 100 as deviation_pct

  FROM gold.overall_metrics
  WHERE metric_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)

SELECT *
FROM metric_validation
WHERE deviation_pct > 30  -- Alert threshold
  AND metric_date = CURRENT_DATE
```

#### Implement Data Lineage Monitoring
- Track data dependencies across the pipeline
- Monitor for upstream changes that could affect metrics
- Alert when source system schemas change

### Improve Data Quality Standards

#### Enhanced Validation Rules
```sql
-- Comprehensive event validation macro
{% macro enhanced_event_validation(table_name) %}
  SELECT
    'data_quality_check' as check_type,
    '{{ table_name }}' as table_name,

    -- Temporal validation
    COUNT(CASE WHEN timestamp > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP THEN 1 END) as future_events,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 1 END) as very_old_events,

    -- Value range validation
    COUNT(CASE WHEN (metadata->>'session_duration_minutes')::int < 0 THEN 1 END) as negative_durations,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN (metadata->>'file_size_mb')::float > 10000 THEN 1 END) as unrealistic_file_sizes,

    -- Business logic validation
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'video_upload' AND metadata->>'video_id' IS NULL THEN 1 END) as upload_missing_video_id,

    -- Referential integrity
    COUNT(CASE WHEN entity_type = 'user' AND entity_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM bronze.users) THEN 1 END) as orphaned_user_events

  FROM {{ table_name }}
  WHERE event_date = CURRENT_DATE
{% endmacro %}
```

#### Implement Tiered Quality Thresholds
- **Tier 1 (Executive dashboards)**: 99.5%+ accuracy, <30min freshness
- **Tier 2 (Operational metrics)**: 95%+ accuracy, <2hr freshness
- **Tier 3 (Exploratory analysis)**: 90%+ accuracy, <24hr freshness

### Strengthen Change Management

#### Pre-Deployment Validation
1. **Schema Change Review Process**
   - All event schema changes require data team approval
   - Impact assessment on downstream metrics
   - Rollback plan for failed deployments

2. **Metric Calculation Changes**
   - A/B testing of new calculation logic
   - Historical backfill validation
   - Business stakeholder approval required

#### Deployment Safeguards
- Canary deployments for data pipeline changes
- Automated rollback triggers for data quality degradation
- Real-time monitoring during deployment windows
